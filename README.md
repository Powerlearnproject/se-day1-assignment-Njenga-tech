Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
software engineering is a branch of computer science that is used in developing,testing and maintaining software application
1.it ensures the development of high quality software that meets user need
2.it drives innovation 
3.it enhance efficiency and support technological advacements in various industries including healtcare finance
Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1.The 1968 Nato conference on software engineering --This conference formally establish software engineering as a discipline 
2.The development of structured programming (1970s introduced better programming practices like modularization and control structures improving software readability and maintainability
3.The rise of Agile methodologies (2001)-The Agile Manifesto introduced flexibility,terative software development processes,revolutionizing how teams collaborate and deliver software  

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1.planning -Defining project scope,feasibility and objective
2.Requirement Analysis-Gathering and documenting functional and non-functional requirements
3.Design-creating architectural and detailed design specification 
4.Implementaion -writing and code the software
5.Testing -Identifying and fixing defects to ensure software quality 
6.Deployment -realising the software for users
7.Maintance -providing updates bug fixes and improvement


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate
waterfall methodology 
1.linear and sequential approach
2.Each phase must be completed before moving to the next 
3.Best for project with well defined requirement 
Agile methodology 
1.interative and incremental development 
2.Encourages collaboration and flexibility
3.Ideal for project with evolving requirements
Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
software developer
1.writes and maintains codes
2.collaboration with designers and tester
3.debug and optimizes software perfomance
Quality assurance engineer
1.Designs and executes test plans 
2.Identifies bugs and densure software raliability
3.Work closely with developers to improves software quality
Project Manager
1.Plans and monitor project progress
2.Manages timelines,budget and team coordination
3.Ensure projectgoal align with business objectives 

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Integrated development enviroments
1.Enhance productivity by providing tools like syntax highlighting debugging and code completion example visual studio code
Version control system
1.It tract changes to code,facilitate collaboration and enable rollback example gvit

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
1.Managing complexity -use modular design,documentation and design pattern
2.Meeting deadline -implement Agile practices and prioritize tasks
3.Deburging and troubleshooting -utilize logging tools and debugging frameworks
4.Keep up with technology-Engages in continous learning and participate in tech communities 

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
1.unit testing-test individual component,ensures small sections of code funtion correctly
2.Integration testing -ensures different modules work together as expected  


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
prompt engineering-is the practice of designing effective prompt to interact   AI generated responses enhancing accuracy and ensuring meaningful interactions

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
1.Improved prompt "explain the basics of artificial intelligence including its key applications in health and finance provide real-world examples"
